# Directed covers

A directed `P`-cover of a scheme `X` is a cover `𝒰` with an ordering
on the indices and compatible transition maps `𝒰ᵢ ⟶ 𝒰ⱼ` for `i ≤ j` such that
every `x : 𝒰ᵢ ×[X] 𝒰ⱼ` comes from some `𝒰ₖ` for a `k ≤ i` and `k ≤ j`.

Gluing along directed covers is easier, because the intersections `𝒰ᵢ ×[X] 𝒰ⱼ` can
be covered by a subcover of `𝒰`.

Many natural covers are naturally directed, most importantly the cover of all affine
opens of a scheme.
